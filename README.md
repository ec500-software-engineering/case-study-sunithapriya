Case Study Topic - TensorFlow

# What is TensorFlow?
* Created by the Google Brain team, TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.  It helps in developing and training ML models. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources.
* It was released under the Apache 2.0 open-source license on November 9, 2015. 
* TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUS and GPUs. 
* It is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS.
* Its flexible architecture allows for the easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge device

# Why TensorFlow?
* Easy model building - Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras
* Robust ML production anywhere - Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.
*	Powerful experimentation for research - A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.
